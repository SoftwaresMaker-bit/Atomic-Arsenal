Proyect Atomic Arsenal 

Atomic Arsenal(AA) is a turn based RPG where the player will create an arsenal of chemical weapons and fight a diversity of elemental enemies. This game will test the strategy skills
and the Chemistry knowlegde of the player. The idea of the game is that each enemy or weapon has its own element/molecule and electronegativity as a property. If,for example, you use a 
hydrogen weapon in a water enemy you will create a Hydrogen Bond and deal extra damage. This link between chemistry and a turn based game makes the dynamic unique, interesting and at some
point academic. This project will benefit from the use of Objet Oriented Programming since each object will have its own chemical properties and they will interact through functionalities
with other objects. This project is planned to be run in terminal since it will not include any graphics or sprites. The goal is to create throught OOP and C++ a fun turn based game that
requires minimun resources and is chemistry related.
 
This game will require OOP for creating, controlling and modifying the entities of the game like the enemies, the player, the items, the game controller, and the scenery. The player 
will have properties like its Health Points (HP) and functions like attack or use an item. Their will be classes like Enemies and Items with its own Chemical properties like element, Polarity and electronegativity.
